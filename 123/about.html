			<p>Lipstick is a cosmetic product containing pigments, oils, waxes, 
			and emollients that apply colour, texture, and protection to the lips. 
			Many varieties of lipstick exist. As with most other types of makeup, 
			lipstick is typically, but not exclusively, worn by women. The use of 
			lipstick dates back to ancient times.</p>
			<p>Ancient Sumerian men and women were possibly the first to invent 
			and wear lipstick, about 5,000 years ago They crushed gemstones and 
			used them to decorate their faces, mainly on the lips and around the 
			eyes. Also around 3000 BC to 1500 BC, women in the ancient Indus Valley
			Civilization applied red tinted lipstick to their lips for face decoration.  
			Ancient Egyptians extracted red dye from fucus-algin, 0.01% iodine, and some
			bromine mannite, but this dye resulted in serious illness; they used by 
			prostitutes who specialized in oral sex to advertise their services. 
			Lipsticks with shimmering effects were initially made using a pearlescent
			substance found in fish scales.</p>
			<p>During the Islamic Golden Age the notable Arab Andalusian cosmetologist 
			Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) invented solid lipsticks, which were 
			perfumed sticks rolled and pressed in special molds, and he described 
			them in his Al-Tasrif.</p>
			<p>Lip colouring started to gain some popularity in 16th century England. 
			During the time of Queen Elizabeth I bright red lips and a stark white 
			face became fashionable. At that time, lipstick was made from a blend 
			of beeswax and red stains from plants. Only upper class women and male 
			actors wore makeup.</p>
			<p>In 1770 a British law was proposed to the Parliament that a marriage 
			should be annulled if the woman wore cosmetics before her wedding day.</p>
			<p>Throughout most of the 19th century the obvious use of cosmetics was
			not considered acceptable in Britain for respectable women, and it 
			was associated with marginalized groups such as actors and prostitutes. 
			It was considered brazen and uncouth to wear makeup. In the 1850s, 
			reports were being published warning women of the dangers of using 
			century, Guerlain, a French cosmetic company, began to manufacture
			lipstick. The first commercial lipstick had been invented in 1884, 
			by perfumers in Paris, France. It was covered in silk paper and made from 
			deer tallow, castor oil, and beeswax. Before then, lipstick had been 
			created at home. Complete acceptance of the undisguised use of cosmetics
			in England appears to have arrived for the fashionable Londoner at least by 1921.</p>
